# Categorical Data Analysis Final

## Case Study 2

For the second case study, build a predictive model using a self-rated health category for individuals in their midlife as an outcome variable. Select the correct model based on the distribution of the outcomevariable. 

In step 1, you will fit and conduct the main effects model with the variables depress, alcage, cigage, age, and bp. 

In step 2, you will test any relevant assumptions. 

In step 3 [2 bonus points], predict probabilities for those with diagnosed high blood pressure if (1) age = 64 and depress = 0, and (2) if age =64 and depress = 1. Report the difference in probabilities per group (i.e., excellent, good, fair, poor).
